# Libless-NN
A libraryless Neural Network in Python (not even Numpy)

A rather impractical Neural Network scaleable to theoretically any size. Used to better understand how a Neural Network works via an array-based system.

Also includes some data generation, although the algorithm is a bit finicky and it would probably be best to find and import the MNIST or something else

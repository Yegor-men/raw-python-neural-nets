# Libless-NN

This project is more personal than anything but free to use if anyone wants. The base model does not require any libraries and runs on raw Python. There is another Numpyfied version that, as you guessed, uses Numpy to speed up the calculations. The purpose of the base model was mostly more of a personal challenge and to better understand how NNs work more than anything

Both of them are quite flexible and are technically scalable to any size, but it depends on your processing power. Export weights and biases is in there as well. You can modify the code a little if you want to do something with the weights and biases or with the outputs too.

The Numpy version is faster on larger models

Have fun

# Libless-NN

A libraryless Neural Network in Python (Not even Numpy)

A rather slow and impractical Neural Network scaleable to theoretically any size. Used to better understand how a Neural Network works via an array-based system. The base version is without any libraries while there is also one that makes use of Numpy and subsequently matrixes.

Also includes some data generation, although the algorithm is a bit finnicky and it would probably be best to find and import the MNIST or something else, whatever is wanted.

Will later be expanded to image and text gen and stuff
